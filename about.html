		<h1>About this Application</h1>

		<h2>How to use this app</h2>
		<p>
			Talk into your microfon and look at the spectrogram to see the frequency with which this software thinks you are speeking.
			But be aware that you cannot take the numbers too seriously, because detecting the main-frequency is in fact kinda hard;
			Higher harmonics in particular can be quite confusing, see <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Fiona/111783399178525244"> this post</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then try out all the other buttons, write a more detailed explanation and ask to have it added to this section, because the current version is mostly a placeholder. üòâÔ∏é

		<h2>Contributing</h2>
		<p>
		Contributions are always very welcome! Check out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/FJW/free-trans-voice-analyzer/">Project-Page on Gitlab</a>!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are a programmer and willing to put up with typescript you can either check out the existing <a href="https://gitlab.com/FJW/free-trans-voice-analyzer/-/issues">issues</a>,
			submit new features you thought of for yourself (but maybe coordinate before you put in too much time),
			or do what is the most honorable task of all and reduce technical debt.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don‚Äôt know how to program, despair not:
			Programmers are notoriously lazy when it comes to wrting documentation, which in this case even includes advice for voice-training.
			Help there would be very valuable.
			You can also submit texts to read, especially texts in languages that are not yet covered (just make sure they are in the public domain to avoid licensing issues).

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			This project started when Fiona wanted to do her daily (in theory at least) voice-training with a certain ‚ÄúTrans Voice Training‚Äù app.
			She was however greeted with a consent form for comprehensive user-tracking that, while pretending to be so, was in many ways non-compliant with the GDPR and even worse, didn‚Äôt take no for an answer:
			After she unselected everything the app told her that her choice did not meet the minimum tracking-requirements to use the free version of the app.
			Paying for the app on the other hand would have meant giving payment-information to google which was even more of a non-starter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Considering that this had already been on her mind for a while at this point, this was all that was needed to start writing her own app and
			<a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Fiona/111623723568475914">posted about a preliminary version on mastodon</a> that got very large amounts of interested feedback right from the start.
		</p>
		<p>
			This background-story established several key-requirements for this app in order to prevent a repetition of this kind of story:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This software is implemented as a web-app, ensuring that it is as cross-platform as possible;
				to ensure that the later stays that way, it does not use any extensions beyond what web-standards guarantee (if you notice that it does, please file a bug-report).
			</li>
			<li>
				This project would be free software, both free as in free speech and free as in free beer.
				A strong (if not the strongest) copyleft license (AGPL V3 or later) ensures that things stay like that.
			</li>
			<li>
				All functionality happens client side.
				The only thing the webserver does is deliver files and it is possible to download them and open the files of the filesystem in the web-browser.
			</li>
			<li>
				No external ressources of any kind in any form.
				Your meta-data stay between you, the webserver (if any) and your internet-service-provider; your data stay with you alone, unless you explicitly ask the webserver to store something for you.
				(At this time there is no functionality to store anything server-side, this provision is just here to cover any potential future features.)
			</li>
		</ul>
